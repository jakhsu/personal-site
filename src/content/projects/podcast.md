**Note:**

This project is still under active development, so please check out: [Github](https://github.com/jakhsu/podcast) for the code, and [deployed site](https://podcast-dusky-nine.vercel.app/)

**Project Overview:**

Due to the the sunsetting of Google's podcast app, I'm in need for a replacement of a simple podcast app that just focuses on podcast. I feel like there are suprisingly few podcast apps that do these things:

- have modern, cool looking, and even customizable themes
- offer a sleek user experience
- have useful features that are powered by AI

For the time being, I'm just focus on building the app out, so more write up will come later.
