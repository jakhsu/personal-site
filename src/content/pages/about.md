## Jack Hsu - Frontend Developer based in Taiwan

**Hello World!** I'm Jack Hsu, a frontend developer living in [Taiwan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan), home of bubble teaüßã. With a passion for delightful user experience, I specialises in building sleek UI with a focus on elegant and maintainable code.

## Skills and Expertise

I specialize in front-end development, utilizing the latest technologies to build responsive, user-friendly and crossplatform applications. My proficiency includes:

- web fundamentals like **HTML**, **CSS**, **TypeScript** (not looking back to Javascript after I learned about TS). And always try to keep up with the latest updated on language specs, like the new temporal object coming to JS, or the introduction of signal to JS.
- for frontend frameworks, I started out with **Vue 2** and briefly touched **Vue 3** and **Nuxt**, then moved to **React** and **Next** due to demand of my last job. Frankly, I try to be pragmatic with these ever-changing frameworks/tech, and learn the pattern they introduces and the problems they are trying to solve, instead of being married to any specific tool.
- I also like to develope **React Native** apps. Used it heavily in my last job, and was able to shared the majority of the component code, which brings a lot of speed and allow easier styling consistency across platforms.
- I'm also a huge fan of **TailwindCSS**, once it clicks, it's hard to go back to traditional CSS. From my personal experience, it excels at being easily readible despite being verbose, and the utility-first approach makes it work perfectly with component-based frameworks, which is the common pattern in today's frontend frameworks.
- On the server side, I'm also actively learing things like **NestJs** and **PostgreSQL** to get a more complete picture across the stack.
- UI/UX design is also something I'm actively working on. Not only to better communicate with designers, but I think it helps frontend devs to better understand why certain decisions are made instead of just focusing on the implementation details. A classic example I ran into recently:
  <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Act on press<br><br>This is a UI design hill I will die on, and it dismays me how often and hard I have had to fight for it.<br><br>Almost all interaction methods have a ‚Äúpress‚Äù and ‚Äúrelease‚Äù event associated with them. Whenever possible, you should ‚Äúdo the thing‚Äù when you get the press‚Ä¶</p>&mdash; John Carmack (@ID_AA_Carmack) <a href="https://twitter.com/ID_AA_Carmack/status/1787850053912064005?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 7, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
